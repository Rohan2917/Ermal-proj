        <h2 class="text-center">Fees and Payment</h2>
        <p>During your registration, you may be offered a 3 day trial. If you cancel your account within the 3 day trial period, you will only see the verification charges and their corresponding refunds in your statement. If you do not cancel your account within this time, your account will be automatically extended to a premium account at the cost of 99 EUR per month.</p>
        <p>During the registration to Readaway, you may also get the option to instantly purchase a premium account at the cost of 99 EUR per month. Your account will be charged with the monthly fee immediately, with no free-of-charge period included, and the monthly charges will continue automatically until your account is canceled.</p>
        <p>By starting your Readaway membership, either by selecting a 3 day trial or making the instant purchase of a premium account, you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you a monthly membership fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the provider service to the Payment Method you provided during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).</p>
        <p>You can use the following Payment Methods: Credit/debit card or bank account.</p>
        <p>Please note that prices and charges are subject to change with notice. As used in these Terms of Use, “billing” shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. The membership fee will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. In some cases your billing date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your premium membership began on the day not contained in a given month. Visit Readaway.net to see the date of your next payment („Next billing”).</p>
        <p>Membership charges are fully earned upon payment. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly in one or more charges. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. All the herein mentioned prices and charges shall be considered gross prices, and contain all the taxes, however they do not contain any commissions or charges you may incur in connection with the particular chosen Payment Method. If you choose to use the particular Payment Method, you declare acknowledge and consent to its terms and use, and you accept making payment in this manner. Provider, within the limits allowed by law, is not responsible for any inconveniences or damages caused by usage of the particular Payment Method, especially delays or impossibility to make payment. In such case you should complain about those services to their provider, in the manner provided by their terms and use. If the Payment was not accepted because of any reasons attributable to provider, please contact us via e-mail address: support@ Readaway.net. By the acceptance of hereby Terms of Use, you declare, that all the payments shall be made with the funds from a legitimate source. By the acceptance of hereby Terms of Use, you consent to pass your personal data (i.e.: name, surname, address, e-mail address and bank account number) to the provider of any Payment Method you chose, for the purpose of making the payment. Please note that if a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the premium account services until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method.</p>
        <p>Internet Access Charges: You are responsible for any costs you incur to access the internet.</p>
        <p>3 day trial: If you are eligible, and have signed up for a 3 day trial, your Payment Method will be authorized for up to approximately one month of service during 3 day trial; however, no charges will be made against the Payment Method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your 3 day trial period. We may also periodically authorize your card in anticipation of membership or related charges. Membership fees and charges are fully earned upon payment. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance. We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email. If you want to use a different Payment Method or if there is a change in Payment Method, such as your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our website and clicking on the “Your Account” link, available at the top of the pages of the provider website. If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, “Cancellation” below), you authorize us to continue billing that Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.</p>
        <p>Credit/debit card registration</p>
        <p>In order to increase the safety and security of every customer who uses our services, Readaway may post a verification charge to your credit or debit card, with an amount of 1 EUR. Please note these charges will be automatically refunded to your account and are exclusively for the purpose of validating the customers payment method. These verification charges may occur within the first 30 days of the registration period, as well as at any point during the duration of the service. Readaway may request the customer to enter this variable amount in order to verify that he is the legitimate and authorized account holder. Should you have any questions related to these charges, please contact us via Readaway.net or email us at: support@ Readaway.net. If you have signed up for a 3 day trial and do not cancel your account within one week, your account will automatically be extended to a premium account. If you have made an instant purchase of a premium account, your account will be charged immediately, and the monthly charges will continue automatically.</p>
        <p>Just after a successful registration you will immediately receive a confirmation email containing the details of your subscription:</p>

   <p>You may cancel your Readaway membership at any time and you will continue to have access to the Readaway service through the end of your monthly billing period. Please note that you must cancel your subscription before it renews each Monthly Period in order to avoid the next billing. To cancel your account you may go to your account settings and choose cancel account. You may also contact us on Readaway.net.</p>
   <p>To make sure you won’t forget about the change of your subscription, 24 hours prior to the end of your 3 day trial period you will be informed about it via email. The email will include information about your subscription (e.g. billing, subscription period, range of your subscription plan) and the link that will allow you to cancel your subscription if you decide to do so.</p>
   <p>If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current Monthly Period – this means that you will have continued access to Brainpuzzler for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund.</p>
   <p>FRAUD & UNAUTHORIZED USE: Readaway is concerned with your security and protects you from fraud.

   <p>No-refunds: Please note that payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds for any partial-month membership periods or unwatched movies or TV shows.

The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>
   <p>After any termination, you understand and acknowledge that we will have no further obligation to provide the Site or Services and all licenses and other rights granted to you by these Terms of Use will immediately cease.
